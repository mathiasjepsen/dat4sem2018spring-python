    "# Getting Things Done with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is it about?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics\n",
    "We will learn about Python’s basic data types, basic data structures, control structures, expressions, statements, operators, and program operation. Additionally, we will learn how to use “Jupyter Notebooks“, as interactive programming environment and its application for knowledge presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection\n",
    "We will learn how to automatically download files from the web, scrape text and images from web pages, and how to read and write various file formats, such as text files, CSV files, JSON files, Excel files, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Visualization\n",
    "We will learn how to plot data into various plot styles, such as, line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, on maps, etc. using different technologies, such as “matplotlib”, “pygal”, and “bokeh”.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "We will apply some common algorithms in data science, such as “KMeans”, “Mean Shift”, “Page Rank”, etc. Additionally, we will learn how to make use of the most prominent science libraries “NumPy” and “Pandas” for effective and efficient data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Processing\n",
    "We will have a look at basic image processing tasks, such as, reading image files, morphological operations, colour spaces, and the application of “OpenCV” to process images and streams of images automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automation\n",
    "On top of automatic web scraping, we will have a look at UI automation and the “Selenium“ framework to let computers perform the boring and repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why does it matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Quickly answering questions, i.e., data science.\n",
    "  * Give you tools for your further professional and educational careers.\n",
    "  * Build protoypes and glue systems effectively and efficiently.\n",

    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many good and powerful programming languages in the world. Usually, each language is good for a certain type of job. To me, and many others, Python is an incredibly efficient language. \n",
    "\n",
    "It enables short, concise and high-level programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's syntax is quite straight forward, allowing you to write clean code, which is easily understood by others and which can be easily used, extended and debugged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is used in many domains, for example to\n",
    "  * create of games\n",
    "  * build web applications\n",
    "  * solve business and scientific problems\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used in incredibly many projects, see https://www.python.org/about/success/, http://pythonhackers.com/open-source/, and https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#what-is-python\n",
    "\n",
    "See some of the following systems, which are build in Python.\n",

    "  * object-oriented programming language. \n",
    "  \n",
    "It incorporates **modules**, **exceptions**, **dynamic typing**, **very high level dynamic data types**, and classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is **portable**: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name Python comes from the surreal British comedy group Monty Python, not from the snake.\n",

    "# Literature\n",

    "    * **Each group reviews** (parts of) another groups solution twice. Once during the teaching phase and once during the project phase.\n",

    "The main project will be executed in exactly the same manner as the exercises above. However, the main project phases is at least three weeks\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Find data source.\n",
    "  * Formulate a problem.\n",
